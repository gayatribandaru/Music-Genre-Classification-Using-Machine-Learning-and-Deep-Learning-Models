## About This Project

This project was created to:

- **Learn and apply** machine learning and deep learning techniques.
- **Classify music genres** based on audio features.
- **Compare the performance** of different models like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

I have shared this project on GitHub to help others who are interested in **music information retrieval**, **audio classification**, and **machine learning**.
